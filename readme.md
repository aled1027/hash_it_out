Hash-it-out is a generic look-aside cache.
A look-aside cache is a key-value storage for items that are difficult or slow to compute.

## TODO
- add #pragma once where necessary
- run valgrind on all tests
- consistent coding style?
- go over code to make sure it's cleaaaan looking
- add some explanation of how our hash-bucket double linked list is working
  - mention asymptotics, collisions, etc.
- dynamic resizing
- eviction policy
